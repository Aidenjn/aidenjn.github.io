They can be found on the Misc. (Miscellaneous Things ðŸ“Ž) page.</p><p>There are a few reasons I want to have a website. First, I feel it is somewhat of an expectation in my line of work to have a professional portfolio, and along with that, a website to showcase said portfolio. The <a href=/portfolio>Tech Portfolio</a> page, which is still under construction, will fufill that function. Another reason I want to have a website is to showcase my creative works. The <a href=/gallery>Art Gallery</a> page, which is also under construction, will fufill that role for the most part. Although, seperate from that page, I have just created a <a href=/films>page</a> to showcase the videos I have worked on.</p><p>This brings me to my third and fourth reasons to have a website, which are to be able to share things with others and reference things for myself more easily. The videos I have worked on are things I like to share with others, but so are the recipes I use. Both of these things I have wanted a central place to reference for a long time. The recipes I use can be found <a href=/foodstuff>here</a> on this site.</p></div></div><p class="footer text-center">Copyright (c) 2023 Aiden Nelson</p><script src=/js/feather.min.js></script>
