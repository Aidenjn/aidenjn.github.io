The food goals of Aiden Nelson are:</p><p>‚ö°Ô∏è
Be able to whip up something good fast.</p><ul><li>The most important thing to Aiden is to be able to procure an enjoyable meal but not at the cost of a huge amount of time. In other words, the goal is to have the highest yum to make-speed ratio.</li></ul><p>üêÄ
Meal prep as much as possible to prevent scrounging behavior.</p><ul><li>Now that Aiden has finished his student-career he wants to move on from microwave-baked potatoes and box Mac n‚Äô Cheese. To increase the likelihood of procuring a quality meal the right ingredients need to be present and ready to assemble. This involves buying certain things while shopping, preparing a list of things to get before going shopping, and having a plan of what to do with said ingredients, how to prepare them for ready-use, and when to prepare and use them.</li></ul><p>üîÆ
Have lots of options to account for as many conceivable meal-related scenarios as possible.</p><ul><li>Ideally this document could be consulted for a range of different situations from trying to feed the self with something reasonably quick-to-make and healthy, to trying to feed a crowd of gluten-free vegans something thats still yummy for carnivores.</li></ul><h1 id=term-definitions>Term Definitions</h1><ul><li><strong>Tasty</strong> - Tastes good.</li><li><strong>Healthy</strong> - Feels healthy to eat or is actually healthy according to science.</li><li><strong>Yum/yummy</strong> - Tastes good when eating and feels healthy when eating and after eating.</li></ul><h1 id=document-organization>Document Organization</h1><p>Recipes for substances that are typically assembled into greater meals are located in the <a href=#recipe-appendix>Recipe Appendix</a>.
