<strong>Be able to whip up something good fast.</strong></p><p>The most important thing for me is to be able to procure an enjoyable meal but not at the cost of a huge amount of time. In other words, the goal is to have the highest yum to make-speed ratio.</p><p>🐀
<strong>Meal prep as much as possible to prevent scrounging behavior.</strong></p><p>Now that I have finished my student-career I want to move on from microwave-baked potatoes and box Mac n’ Cheese. To increase the likelihood of procuring a quality meal the right ingredients need to be present and ready to assemble. This involves buying certain things while shopping, preparing a list of things to get before going shopping, and having a plan of what to do with said ingredients, how to prepare them for ready-use, and when to prepare and use them.</p><p>🔮
