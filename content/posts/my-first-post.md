Welcome to my new website!

<!--more-->

The closest thing to a personal website that I have ever created is the art gallery site I created many years ago: aidensfineart.com. Now that the lease on that domain name has expired, I decided that it was time to start anew (with free hosting from Github). I am not trying to do anything too fancy. I just need something for displaying some static images and markdown files. I searched far and wide and found a tool that I think fits the bill called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/).

More info coming soon!
