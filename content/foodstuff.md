# Document Organization

This document is divided into several sections.
Most of these sections are lists of recipes that I use regularly enough to want to reference them here.
The [Purpose Statement](#purpose-statement) describes my thoughts and philosophy in creating this document.
The [Term Definitions](#term-definitions) defines some of the terms I use in the document to leave them less open to interpretation.
Each subsequent section in contains instructions for creating delicous cuisine units.
[Meals for Self](#meals-for-self) contains instructions for creating great single meals for oneself.
[Feeding the Crowds](#feeding-the-crowds) contains instructions for creating more banquet-type meals that can feed a group.
[Fancy Food](#fancy-food) contains instructions for creating meals that take a lot more time and effort than the typical fare. 
[Lavish Treats](#lavish-treats) contains instructions for creating desserts.
[Miscellaneous Foodstuff](#miscellaneous-foodstuff) contains instructions for creating other fun edible things I didn't feel like categorizing.
Recipes for substances that are typically assembled into greater meals are located in the [Recipe Appendix](#recipe-appendix).

# Purpose Statement

The purpose of this document is to provide a document for me, by me, to improve my intentionality and efficiency in making food for myself and others while being in alignment with my food goals. My food goals of are:

‚ö°Ô∏è
**Be able to whip up something good fast.**

The most important thing for me is to be able to procure an enjoyable meal but not at the cost of a huge amount of time. In other words, the goal is to have the highest yum to make-speed ratio.

üêÄ
**Meal prep as much as possible to prevent scrounging behavior.**

Now that I have finished my student-career I want to move on from microwave-baked potatoes and box Mac n‚Äô Cheese. To increase the likelihood of procuring a quality meal the right ingredients need to be present and ready to assemble.  This involves buying certain things while shopping, preparing a list of things to get before going shopping, and having a plan of what to do with said ingredients, how to prepare them for ready-use, and when to prepare and use them.

üîÆ
**Have lots of options to account for as many conceivable meal-related scenarios as possible.**

Ideally this document could be consulted for a range of different situations from trying to feed the self with something reasonably quick-to-make and healthy, to trying to feed a crowd of gluten-free vegans something thats still yummy for carnivores.

### Chocolate Chip

**Description:**
This will make make about 3 dozen cookies. It is the best chocolate chip cookie recipe that I know of. This recipe is a modified version of [this recipe](https://www.cooksillustrated.com/recipes/1144-thick-and-chewy-chocolate-chip-cookies) from Cook's Illustrated.

**Ingredients:**
- 4 1/2 cups all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspoon table or kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon baking soda
- 3 sticks (24 teaspoons) of softened or room temperature butter 
- 2 cup brown sugar (light or dark)
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- 2 large egg
- 2 large egg yolk
- 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
- 4 cups of chocolate chips or chunks (sweet, swemisweet, or bittersweet as per your preference) OR 2 cup of chocolate chips and 2 cup of chopped pecans or walnuts

**Directions:**
1. Heat oven to 325 degrees.
2. Mix dry ingredients (flour, salt, and baking soda) together in a bowl and set aside. 
3. Mix butter and sugars until thoroughly blended, then mix in egg, egg yolk, and vanilla until thoroughly blended.
4. Mix in dry ingredients a third at a time into sugar blend. Mix until just combined. 
5. Stir in chips (and nuts if you're using them).
6. Create cookie dough balls from dough (1/4 cup of dough is a decently large cookie) and place onto plate.
7. Prepare baking sheets with parchement paper (or just rub them with butter or oil to prevent stick).
8. Place each cookie dough balls on the baking sheets by ripping the ball in half, joining it back together (non ripped side to non ripped side) and placing it on the sheet. This step is for giving the cookies texture, and can be skipped if you want smoother, less textured cookies.
9. Cook cookies for 15-18 minutes. Start checking at 15 minutes. Cookies left in closer to 15 minutes will be chewier and cookies left in 18 minutes or more will be crunchier. If you are cooking more than one sheet at a time make sure swap the positions of the sheets halfway through cooking (7-9 minutes through). 
10. Serve after 2 minutes for a melty yummy time, and store extras in an airtight container.
