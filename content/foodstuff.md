# Purpose Statement

The purpose of this document is to provide a document for Aiden, by Aiden, to improve his intentionality and efficiency in making food for himself and others while being in alignment with his food goals. The food goals of Aiden Nelson are:

‚ö°Ô∏è
Be able to whip up something good fast. 
- The most important thing to Aiden is to be able to procure an enjoyable meal but not at the cost of a huge amount of time. In other words, the goal is to have the highest yum to make-speed ratio.

üêÄ
Meal prep as much as possible to prevent scrounging behavior. 
- Now that Aiden has finished his student-career he wants to move on from microwave-baked potatoes and box Mac n‚Äô Cheese. To increase the likelihood of procuring a quality meal the right ingredients need to be present and ready to assemble.  This involves buying certain things while shopping, preparing a list of things to get before going shopping, and having a plan of what to do with said ingredients, how to prepare them for ready-use, and when to prepare and use them.

üîÆ
Have lots of options to account for as many conceivable meal-related scenarios as possible.
- Ideally this document could be consulted for a range of different situations from trying to feed the self with something reasonably quick-to-make and healthy, to trying to feed a crowd of gluten-free vegans something thats still yummy for carnivores.
